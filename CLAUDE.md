# Amy FX Project Guidelines

## UI Design Guidelines (Dark Premium Fintech)

When developing or modifying UI components for the **Amy FX** project, strictly adhere to the following invariant rules to maintain a professional, high-end "Dark Premium Fintech" aesthetic:

1. **Theme & Vibe:** 
   - **Dark Premium Fintech**: Use very dark/pure black backgrounds (e.g., `#0a0a0a`).
   - Implement subtle glowing effects (`box-shadow` with low opacity) instead of flat colors.
   - Maintain a "modern terminal" nuance.

2. **Color Palette:**
   - **Gold** (`var(--gold)`): Used for accents, current price highlights, active badges, and network connection lines.
   - **Neon Red** (`var(--red)` / `#ff4c4c`): Strictly for Resistance, Ask Liquidity, BSL, or Sell signals. Must include a soft red glow.
   - **Neon Green** (`var(--green)` / `#00d97e`): Strictly for Support, Bid Liquidity, SSL, or Buy signals. Must include a soft green glow.

3. **Typography:**
   - **Numbers & Prices**: Must always use a `monospace` font (e.g., `Courier New`) to look like a professional Bloomberg terminal. Make them bold/thick.
   - **Labels**: Clean, small, uppercase sans-serif text.

4. **Component Architecture:**
   - Avoid plain vertical lists for data. Use data-rich dashboard components (e.g., Node Cards, Segmented Bars, Network Trees).
   - Ensure clear visual hierarchy (Current Price is always the glowing center/focus).
